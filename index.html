                    I've been a 
                    <span class="bold">startup entrepreneur</span>
                     since 2007 in online media, and health & wellness with a focus in 
                    <span class="bold">e-commerce since 2015</span>.
                    I've helped scale companies into 
                    <span class="bold">7 figures</span>
                     in sales and have spent over 
                    <span class="bold">1MM</span>
                     on Facebook profitably driving traffic with an average ROAS of 2.3X. I was self taught in programming until recently when I decided to take my skills to another level by enrolling in a 6 month coding bootcamp with Thinkful. I plan to use my new level of skills to hire and work with a small team of 
                    <span class="bold">super devs</span>
                     to offer new and exciting web app features for my newest venture 
                    <span class="bold">Katy Keto</span>.
